This is the repository documenting my project on Drug Sentiment Classification. The following repositories are included:

Script: contains all the executables to reproduce the models and the data and business value sensitivity analysis. 
Model: contains the save of all explored classifiers, gridsearch objects and model results.
Data: contains all data and intermediates pertinent to the project
Report: contains all the reports outlining the results of the project
A good start to begin understanding the approaches of the project is to read the Final Report in the Report repository.
