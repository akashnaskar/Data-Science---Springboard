### Springboard Data Science Immersive
This repository will house all code, data, and files related to my work in the Springboard Data Science Immersive program. The following acts as a table of contents for the whole repository with links to the respective work cited.

### Capstone Projects (Full Scale Data Science Projects)

## [Building A Spam Filter With Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/zachnguyen/Data-Science---Springboard/tree/master/SMS%20Spam%20Filter)

# Key points:
- Python tools: Pandas, Json, Nltk, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Spacy, Statsmodel.
- Performed spam classification for hypothetical a hypothetical telecom, achieving a model with 99.4% accuracy score and 0.997 AUC (Area Under the Curve) Score.
- Created a complete end-to-end NLP pipeline to process sms messages at throughput of +100 sms/s.
- Converted data to bag of word features and modeled the training data to several algorithms, including Logistic regression, Naive Bayes, SVC and XGBoost.
- Regularized best algorithm architecture with F-Beta score to ensure alignment with business objectives.

## [Sentiment Analysis with Neural Network techniques](https://github.com/zachnguyen/Data-Science---Springboard/tree/master/Drug%20Sentiment%20Review)

# Key Points:
- Python tools: Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Spacy, Gensim, Sci-Py, Tensorflow/Keras.
- Performed sentiment analysis on a highly realistic dataset provided by Analytics Vidha with over 100 drugs for a hypothetical Canadian pharmaceutical, achieving a model with 0.5 F1 macro score with Grid-Search for Hyper-parameter Tuning and Cross Validation.
- Aligned the best algorithm with business objectives by creating trade-off gradient to identify scenarios in which automation of the Sentiment Analysis task is profitable, potentially with a saving of +$400 per 1000 reviews.
- Ran dimensionality reduction algorithms such as TSNE and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to explore language dataset structure.
- Modeled the training data to several algorithms, including Word embedding algorithms (with Skip-Gram, Matrix Factorization and Transfer Learning) and Recurrent Neural Network with LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) component.

### Mini Projects (Small Data Science Projects showcasing specific skills)

## [Clustering Methods K-Nearest Neighbors and PCA](
Key Skills
K-Means
PCA - Principle Component Analysis
Elbow Sum of Squares Method
Mini project on customer segmentation and being able to identify different types of customers and then figure out ways to find more of those individuals so you can get more customers! The data comes from John Foreman's book Data Smart. The dataset contains both information on marketing newsletters/e-mail campaigns (e-mail offers sent) and transaction level data from customers (which offer customers responded to and what they bought).

## Exploratory Data Analysis' (EDA)
Hospital Readmittance Data
Human Temperature Data
Racial Discrimination Data
Key Skills

Central Limit Theorem
Statistical Analysis
Data Visualization
z-test
t-test
Margin of Error (MOE)
Chi-Squared Test
Bootstrap Statistics
Several EDA's performed on varying data categories. Hospital Readmittance performs a statistical analysis on a previously done analysis to critique its validity. Human Temperature EDA uses bootstrap statistics to determine the true average temperature of the human body in both male and females. Racial Discrimination performs a statistical analysis on if race has a meaningful impact on the callback rate of candidates who have submitted resumes to jobs of interest.

## Machine Learning Algorithms
Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
Key Skills

## Logistic Regression
Linear Regression
Naive Bayes
Performing several Machine Learning Algorithms in miniprojects such as: Labeling an obersvation as either male or female based on height and weight data (Logistic Regression), Regression Price Estimate on Boston Housing data using Linear Regression, and predicting movie reviews with Naive Bayes Models

## PYSPARK
MapReduce with Pyspark
Performing several exercises utlitizing MapReduce Pyspark (RDD) with a touch of MLlib

Key Skills

Pyspark
RDD
Spark Dataframes
SQL
Yammer SQL Case Study
Key Skills

## SQL
Time Series Analysis
Applied Plotting and Charting
This is a SQL case study as proposed from Mode Analytics at https://modeanalytics.com/. The Jupyter notebook in this repository is a cleaned up verison of the original case study which contains all original SQL queries, and can be found here: https://modeanalytics.com/mooseburger/reports/14cbbb5670b8

## JSON
Data Wrangling with JSON
Key Skills

## JSON Manipulation and Extraction
Applied Plotting and Charting
An exercise of data extraction and exploration utilizing a JSON data source

Ultimate Challenge Parts 1 & 2
Ultimate Challange Part 3
Key Skills

Full Stack Data Scientist
Relax Challenge - Defining an "adopted user" as a user who has logged into a product on three separate days in at least one seven-day period, identify which factors predict future user adoption. You are given two datasets

A user table ("takehome_users") with data on 12,000 users who signed up for the product in the last two years
A usage summary table ("takehome_user_engagement") that has a row for each day that a user logged into the product.
